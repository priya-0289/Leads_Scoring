# Leads scoring case study
Problem Statement:

An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. Although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. The company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’.

Need to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.

Goals of the Case Study:

Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
